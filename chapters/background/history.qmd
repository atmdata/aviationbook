Aviation refers to operations of aircraft in general. The word was coined in the middle of the 19th century, derived from the Latin word *avis* for "bird". Historical records mention many legends of human attempting to fly in Greek, Persian, Nordic or Inca mythologies. Around the globe, deities with wings, feathers or other bird attributes appear, and men start to notice that even birds can stay afloat without flapping.

In the 16th century, Leonardo da Vinci imagines flying machines in a secret manuscript of thousands of words and hundreds of sketches of an "ornithopter", at the same period  kites are imported from China and become popular in Europe.

This chapter attempts to draw a quick panorama over the history of aviation, focusing on heavier-than-air aircraft, until the digital age when data started to be produced and stored for further analysis. We split this chapter in several sections, matching important milestones in the history of aviations.

## Flying machines

It all began in the late 18th century with the pioneering efforts of the Montgolfier brothers, Joseph-Michel and Jacques-Étienne, who successfully demonstrated the possibility of manned flight using balloons. On June 4, 1783, in Annonay, France, they launched a 9-meter-tall balloon with a fire underneath that heated the air, causing it to rise and lift the balloon off the ground. This groundbreaking event marked the birth of aviation and set the stage for future innovations.

Building upon the success of balloons, the concept of dirigibles or airships emerged in the late 19th century. Ferdinand von Zeppelin, a German inventor, took the lead in developing rigid airships. His creations, known as Zeppelins, featured a metal framework covered with fabric and contained multiple gas cells for buoyancy. The first fully controllable Zeppelin, LZ1, took flight on July 2, 1900, near Lake Constance in Friedrichshafen, Germany. This marked a significant milestone in aviation, showcasing the potential for long-distance travel and commercial applications.

Meanwhile, advancements in glider technology were also taking place. Otto Lilienthal, a German aviation pioneer, conducted extensive research and made over 2,000 flights between 1891 and 1896. Lilienthal's experiments with various wing designs and control mechanisms greatly contributed to the understanding of aerodynamics and the principles of flight. His work laid the foundation for future aviators, inspiring them to push the boundaries of flight further.

In France, Clément Ader, an engineer and inventor, made notable contributions to aviation history. On October 9, 1890, he flew the Éole, a steam-powered monoplane, which is considered one of the first attempts at powered flight. While the distance covered was limited, Ader's achievement demonstrated the feasibility of powered aviation and encouraged others to pursue similar endeavors.

The turning point in the history of aviation came with the Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur. Inspired by Lilienthal's work, the brothers began experimenting with gliders in the late 19th century. Between 1900 and 1902, they built and tested a series of glider prototypes, refining their understanding of lift, drag, and control. They constructed wind tunnels to collect data and developed their innovative three-axis control system, which allowed for precise maneuverability. The lessons learned from these glider experiments provided the Wright brothers with invaluable insights into the principles of flight and set the stage for their next monumental step: the invention of a powered aircraft.

In 1903, the Wright brothers achieved their groundbreaking accomplishment. They successfully flew the Wright Flyer, a powered aircraft, for approximately 12 seconds in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. This historic flight is considered the first controlled and sustained powered flight in history.

## The pioneer era
1904--1914

The period between the Wright Brothers' groundbreaking flight in 1903 and the following decade witnessed remarkable advancements in the history of aviation. While the Wright Brothers continued to refine their aircraft designs, other notable figures emerged.

One such figure was Alberto Santos-Dumont, a Brazilian aviation pioneer who captured the world's attention with his groundbreaking flights in Europe. In 1901, Santos-Dumont designed, built, and flew the first powered airships, winning the Deutsch Prize when he flew around the Eiffel Tower in his airship No. 6. He further solidified his reputation by piloting the 14-bis, a canard biplane, in Paris, France, in 1906. This flight, witnessed by a large crowd, demonstrated the practicality of powered flight and earned him widespread recognition as a pioneer aviator. Santos-Dumont continued to innovate, incorporating ailerons between the wings to improve lateral stability. His final design, the Demoiselle monoplanes (Nos. 19 to 22), first flown in 1907, became the world's first series production aircraft, with the Demoiselle No. 19 being constructed in only 15 days.

Around the same time, Louis Blériot, a French aviator and inventor, left his mark on aviation history. In 1909, Blériot accomplished a monumental feat by becoming the first person to cross the English Channel in an airplane. His successful flight in the Blériot XI monoplane demonstrated the increasing capabilities of aircraft for long-distance travel. Blériot's achievement inspired a wave of enthusiasm for aviation, fueling a spirit of competition among aviators. Aviation races and competitions gained popularity, driving inventors and pilots to push the boundaries of speed, endurance, and innovation.

The military potential of airplanes was quickly recognized, leading to their use in warfare. Italy became the first country to employ aircraft for military purposes during the Italian-Turkish war in 1911—1912, using them for reconnaissance, bombing, and artillery correction flights in Libya. Bulgaria followed suit, using airplanes to attack and reconnoiter Ottoman positions in the First Balkan War of 1912—1913. However, it was during World War I that airplanes saw significant utilization in offensive, defensive, and reconnaissance capacities by both the Allies and the Central Powers. The war became the first conflict to witness widespread and intensive use of airplanes and airships, showcasing their strategic importance and paving the way for further military aviation development.

##  World War I
1914--1918

Combat, military uses

## The Golden Age
1919--1939

The 1920s and 1930s mark the *Golden Age of aviation*, with the creation first airlines, and strong images in the collective imagery.

##  World War II
1939--1945

 marked the place of aviation in armed conflicts: Pearl Harbor, massive bombing from all sides, and the final role of Enola Gay

## The post-war era
1945--1979

The post-war period etc. radars, ATM, new motors, etc.

## The digital age
The 1980s

Digitalisation, GPS, etc.
