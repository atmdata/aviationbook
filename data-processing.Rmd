# Data processing

This part introduces more advanced mathematical and programming skills.
The tidy paradigm to manipulate data frames is introduced. Challenges
associated with geometrical shapes, geographical coordinates,
trajectories, projections are presented, before introducing common AI
tools for information extraction, prediction and optimisation.

1.  **The tidy paradigm**
    > Examples in R, Javascript, Python

2.  **Processing geometric and geographical data**

3.  **Processing aircraft trajectories**

4.  **Information extraction**

5.  **Optimisation in data analytics**
    > *Include prediction, or make it a different chapter\...*

6.  **Handling uncertainty**
