**Author's note**: This part goes through all the most commonly used data formats in the
aviation and ATM data analysis community.

* Trajectories: radar tracks, ADS-B
* Flight plans
* DDR formats:
   - `exp2`
   - `M1`
   - `M3`
   - `SO6`
   - `ALL FT+`
   - `ADS-B (OSN/traffic)`

Let's distinguish between Flight and trajectory.

Data for a flight include such information as

* aerodrome of departure (ADEP)
* aerodrome of destination (ADES)
* take-off date and time
* landing date and time
* flight ID / flight number / callsign
* aircraft type
* aircraft operator


Data for a trajectory refer typically to a point profile and can
include:

* flight ID / flight number / callsign
* sequence number
* timestamp
* position (longitude, latitude, altitude)
* position ID (i.e. published point ID)
* airspace ID
* (ground / vertical) speed

with timestamp and position as a minimum.



## Flight Lists


### DDR2 `exp2`

The traffic demand file (exp2) can obtained from the EUROCONTROLâ€™s Demand Data Repository
(DDR2) for a selected period of time (typically one day) and geographic area (e.g. FABEC).
The `exp2` includes, for each flight, basic information about the departure time,
the origin and destination airports, a unique flight identifier, the callsign,
the aircraft ICAO code (e.g. A320) and the requested flight level by the airspace user as
submitted in the flight plan.

## Flight trajectories

EUROCONTROL's Network Manager has devised different flight trajectories
formats in order to store and exchange information with the aviation community.

In the following sections we will cover the most known ones: M1, M3, SO6.

### Model 1 (M1)

The flight trajectory known as *Model 1*, *M1* or *Filed Tactical Flight Model (FTFM)* is a
mathematical model containing a point and airspace volume profile created in ETFMS for a flight.
This trajectory is first created when Flight Plan (FP) details, and any subsequent changes,
are received by the Network Operations of EUROCONTROL's
Network Manager^[Aircraft Operators willing to fly IFR flights in the Network Manager (NM)
area of responsibility are mandated to file the relevant Flight Plan to the Network Manager.
The aim of this centralised management of FP's in Europe is linked to one of the NM mandates,
the ability to detect imbalance between demand (willingness to fly) and offer (ATC / airport capacity)
and offer the different impacted ATC/airports to implement measures to resolve the overload (typically
via departure delays or rerouting.)].

The M1 is a translation of a FP (especially Field 15) to a point profile, i.e. a
sequence of 4D positions (timestamp + longitude, latitude, altitude) plus relevant penetrated airspace ID's, 
calculated taking into account the aircraft type performance (via BADA) and the environment restrictions
as published in the [Route Availability Document (RAD)][rad].
