**Author's note**: This part goes through all the most commonly used data formats in the
aviation and ATM data analysis community.

Airspaces & / or aeronautical information in general (AIRAC):

* airport information:
    - ARP
    - runway thresholds
    - parking positions]
* Published Points
* Routes
* SID / STAR

Fatal events both en-route (mid-air collisions) and on the ground (landing or crashes)
are at the origin of modern Air Traffic Control.
In particular, flight plan filing was devised as a means to let
controllers know where an aircraft was supposed to be and eventually be able
to deconflict its trajectory with other flights nearby.
The flight plan together with latest position reports was (and still is) 
the best information available to eventually launch search and rescue operations.

In principle, a flight plan could simply be a list of 4D coordinates (3D + time),
but it surely was computationally and practically difficult to use it as such
by ATC controllers who had to manually follow up airborne flights.
So the en-route network was designed to have fixed and limited  paths to follow.
In doing so the probability of conflicts was increased but at the same time such
network improves the efficiency in spotting them.

The aviation route network is characterized by the definition of geographical
points, waypoints, and segments connecting them, route segments.
