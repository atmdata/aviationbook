Merriam-Webster defines the term **airspace** as "the space lying above the earth or above a certain area of land or water". 
According to the [Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation](https://www.icao.int/publications/Documents/7300_cons.pdf) of 1944, every state "has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory". Horizontally, a state's airspace extends over its entire territoriy, which also include territorial waters. According to the [United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea](https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf), territorial waters extend up to 12 nautical miles (22.2 km) from a state's coastline. Vertically, a state's airspace begins at the earth's surface and ends at an altitude of 100 km above mean sea level, which is also known as the [Kármán-Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line).

In order to manage an airspace, a state usually commissions a so-called **air navigation service provider** (ANSP), which is a public or private entity that offers so-called **air navigation services**. These air navigation services comprise of the following five components:

* Aeronautical Information Management (AIM)
* Air Traffic Management (ATM)
* Meteorological Services (MET)
* Communication, Navigation, Surveillance (CNS)
* Search and Rescue (SAR)

For the remainder of this section, the components of air navigation services are described in more detail.


## Aeronautical Information Management
Aeronautical Information Management (AIM) is considered with the collection, assembly, publication, exchange, and dissemination of quality-assured, timely and digital aeronautical data in collaboration with all relevant stakeholders. Aeronautical data includes aeronautical information publications (AIP), notice to airmen (NOTAM), preflight information bulletins (PIB), and aeronautical information circulars (AIC).

**Aeronautical Information Publications (AIP)**, which contain "aeronautical information of a lasting character essential to air navigation", see [ICAO Annex 15](https://www.bazl.admin.ch/dam/bazl/en/dokumente/Fachleute/Regulationen_und_Grundlagen/icao-annex/icao_annex_15_aeronauticalinformationservices.pdf.download.pdf/an15_cons.pdf), are issued by a state or by an authority of the state, such as an ANSP. Since their structure is standardized by ICAO Annex 15, AIP usually consist of three distinctive parts:

* *GEN - General information*: As the name implies, GEN contains general information, such as the authority responsible for the AIP, locally applied units of measure, abbreviations used in the AIP, locally applicable time zones and daylight saving time regulations, airspace charges regulations, etc.
* *ENR - Information referring to en-route*: ENR contains information that is of importance during the flight, i.e., while aircraft are *en-route*. ENR is divided into the following 6 parts: (i) information on general rules and procedures for visual flight (VFR) and instrument flight (IFR) or the airspace classes applied, (ii) description of the vertical and horizontal spread of airspaces, (iii) description of airways, (iv) description of radio navigation systems and infrastructures, (v) navigation warnings such as military airspaces, known aviation obstacles, danger areas, etc., and (vi) en-route chart material.
* *AD - Information referring to aerodromes*: AD includes information on both aerodromes and heliports and is divided into 3 parts. The first part contains an index of all aerodromes and helipads of a state as well as a description of the classification system of aerodromes applied in the state. Parts 2 and 3 of AD include detailed information on individual aerodromes or heliports, such as opening times, aerodrome operators, available service facilities, dimensions and alignment of runways, runway and approach lights, relevant aeronautical obstructions, etc. detailed maps are also provided, which contain information on ground-based infrastructure, i.e., aprons, taxiway, runways, etc., as well as flight procedures, i.e., standard instrument departures, standard terminal arrival routes, approach procedures.

To keep AIPs up to date, they are revised in an internationally standardized cylce, which is known as the **AIRAC cycle**. This AIRAC cycle follows a fixed 28-day rhythm, which is internationally standardised. The publication dates are known years in advance and are published, for example, by [Eurocontrol](https://www.nm.eurocontrol.int/RAD/common/airac_dates.html).

**Notice to airmen (NOTAM)** A NOTAM contains information that is of importance to personnel involved in flight operations. While AIPs tend to contain static information that is valid over long periods of time and is known well in advance, NOTAMs include information that is dynamic in nature as it is not known far enough in advance to be published in any other way. Indeed, according to [ICAO Annex 15](https://www.bazl.admin.ch/dam/bazl/en/dokumente/Fachleute/Regulationen_und_Grundlagen/icao-annex/icao_annex_15_aeronauticalinformationservices.pdf.download.pdf/an15_cons.pdf), NOTAMs contain "information concerning the establishment, condition or change in any aeronautical facility, service, procedure or hazard...".

**Prefilght information bulletins (PIB)** A PIB consists of a compilation of a number of NOTAMs which are important for the execution of a flight. Consequently, a PIB contains NOTAMs for the origin, destination and alternate airports, as well as NOTAMs for the airspace that the flight is likely to use.

**Aeronautical information circulars (AIC)** [ICAO Annex 15](https://www.bazl.admin.ch/dam/bazl/en/dokumente/Fachleute/Regulationen_und_Grundlagen/icao-annex/icao_annex_15_aeronauticalinformationservices.pdf.download.pdf/an15_cons.pdf) defines an AIC as "a notice containing information that does not qualify for the origination of a NOTAM of for inclusion in the AIP, but which relates to flight safety , air navigation, technical, administrative or legislative matters." For example, AICs are issued to communicate a strategy in which a state explains how it aims to modernise its ground-based navigational aids, or how a certain new procedure will be implemented in the future. 


## Air Traffic Management
The term *air traffic management* (ATM) is defined in ICAO Document 4444 as "the aggregation of the airborne functions and ground-based functions [...] required to ensure the safe and efficient movement of aircraft during all phases of operations", which, in practice, is enabled in practice by the following services: (i) air traffic services, (ii) airspace management, and (iii) air traffic flow management.

### Air Traffic Services
Air Traffic Services (ATS) is concerned with the control, regulation, and assistance of aircraft and flight crews in real time. To this end, ATS has the following four main objectives:

* The avoidance of collisions between aircraft.
* The provision of advice for the safe and efficient conduction of flights.
* The conduction and maintainance of an orderly flow of air traffic.
* The notification and assistance of concerned organisations in case of search and rescue operations.

To achieve these main objectives, ATS provides the following main services: (i) air traffic control (ATC), (ii) air traffic advisory services, (iii) flight information services, and (iv) alerting services. 

**Air Traffic Control (ATC)**: According to [ICAO Annex 11](https://www.bazl.admin.ch/dam/bazl/en/dokumente/Fachleute/Regulationen_und_Grundlagen/icao-annex/icao_annex_11_airtrafficservices.pdf.download.pdf/an11_cons.pdf), ATC is a service, which aims at the prevention of collisions between aircraft being airborne as well as between obstructions and aircraft being on the maneouvring area of an aerodrome. Besides that, ATC ensures the expedition and maintenance of an orderly flow of air traffic.

To prevent collisions, ATC uses so-called *separations*, i.e. the vertical and lateral spatial spacing of aircraft. As a target for separations, ATC uses specified minimum separations, which define exactly which vertical and lateral minimum distances must be maintained at all times. In practice, not all aircraft are separated, as separations are only (i) provided in certain airspace classes and (ii) not offered for all flights. With regard to flights, a distinction is made between aircraft operating under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) and aircraft operating under Visual Flight Rules (VFR). The following table summarises for all airspace classes and types of flight, whether or not separation is provided by ATC. Note, the table must be read as follows: the first column indicates in which airspace class a particular flight is located. The second column indicates whether this flight is operating under IFR or VFR. The third column then indicates which separation services are offered to this flight.

| Airspace Class | Flight Rules             | Separation provided to this flight         |
|----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| A              | Only IFR flights allowed | Between all IFR flights                    |
| B              | IFR, VFR                 | Between all flights                        |
| C              | IFR                      | Between all flights                        |
| C              | VFR                      | Between IFR flights                        |
| D              | IFR                      | Between IFR flights                        |
| D              | VFR                      | No separations                             |
| E              | IFR                      | Between IFR flights                        |
| E              | VFR                      | No separations                             |
| F              | IFR                      | Between IFR flights, as far as practicable |
| F              | VFR                      | No separations                             |
| G              | IFR, VFR                 | No separations                             |

## Communication, Navigation, Surveillance (CNS)
To ensure safe and efficient air transportation, Air Traffic Management (ATM) relies on infrastructure, services, and functions in the areas of Communication, Navigation, and Surveillance (CNS). As such, communication enables the exchange of information, be it in spoken or written form, between crews of aircraft and/or air traffic control. Navigation encompasses all services and infrastructures by means of which aircraft crews find their way through space in order to get from one place to another quickly, efficiently, and safely. Finally, surveillance comprises all technical possibilities by means of which air traffic control can determine the position of aircraft. In the following, the most important services, technologies, and processes in the field of CNS are presented.

### Communication
#### Voice communications
VHF, HF

#### Data communications
ACARS, Data Link

### Navigation
Navigation deals with the question of how aircraft, ships, cars, etc. can move from one place to another in a safe and efficient manner. In this context, the main question navigation is concerned with is how an aircraft, a ship or a car can determine its own position relative to a reference system.

In the past, rather simple and rudimentary methods were used for navigation. Using so-called dead-reckonin, the current position is determined based on a known prior position as well as the current direction and speed of movement. Furthermore, so-called celestial navigation was used, in which the current position is determined based on celestial measurements, i.e. by determining the position of celestial bodies in relation to an observer.

In aviation, the above-mentioned rudimentary methods of navigation can be employed as well. However, over the last century, a number of different, more advanced ways of determining the position of an aircraft have been developed, implemented, and applied. These navigation methods are usually based on infrastructures that are stationed either on land or in space. The most important navigation methods in aviation are described in detail below.

:::

VOR stations were developped in the United States in the 1930s before being deployed after the Second World War. VOR are simple short-ranged ground stations using radio waves to allow any receiver locked on its frequency to determine its bearing with respect to the ground station.

A VOR ground station operates on line of sight (about 200 nautical miles). It uses a phased antenna array to send a strong omnidirectional signal on a determined frequency, serving as a reference for comparison with a highly directional signal rotating clockwise. The phase difference between the reference signal and the directional signal is the bearing from the VOR station to the receiver relative to magnetic north.

VOR stations are often collocated with DME (Distance Measuring Equipments) which measure the distance between an aircraft and a ground station, by timing the propagation delay of radio signals initiated by the airborne interrogator and replicated after a known delay. Again, precise clocks are key to a precise measurement of distances.

Today, VOR stations are being gradually decommissioned as navigation aids move to performance-based navigation.

- add an excerpt of route map
:::

VOR were traditionally used as intersections along airways. A typical airway will jump in non necessarily straight lines from one navigational point to
another. Typical navigational points can be defined as:

- a NDB (Non Directional Beacon, the ancestor of VOR), VOR or DME ground station;
- intersections between two radials from different VOR stations;
- a VOR radial and a DME distance.

Today, more navigational points are defined as simple GPS coordinates.






### Surveillance

#### Radars

The fundamental theory of radar started in late 19th century. Since the 1860s, when the electromagnetic theory was discovered by [James Clerk Maxwell](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell), the foundation for many science and technology fields was laid out. In the late 19th century, [Heinrich Hertz](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Hertz), who proved the existence of electromagnetic waves, also confirmed that metals could reflect radio waves. In the first decades of the 20th century, several systems for using radio waves to provide short-range directional information of objects were developed. German inventor [Christian Hülsmeyer](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_H%C3%BClsmeyer) is often considered as the first person to use radio waves to detect metal objects in 1904.

However, not until the Second World War, was the concept of RAdio Detection And Ranging (RADAR) developed. The technology was simultaneously researched by both major Allies and Axis countries. However, the United Kingdom led the race in developing a functional radar system.
