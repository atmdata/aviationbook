  abstract = {The role of open data in air transport research is analyzed by means of a sample of over 300 research articles. The most used (or available) data types, their sources and their access policies are identified, both for the US and the EU. The analyses show that 70\% of research in air transport is heavily reliant on data, that 70\% of the data sources are curated by governmental bodies and that the US publicizes a wider set of sources, leading to wider usage. Areas for improving accessibility of (mainly European) data sources are outlined and alternative avenues to obtain data are sketched. The fact that Europe is lagging considerably in making its sources readily available to the research community means Europe missing out on entrepreneurship, innovation and scientific discovery, the presumed benefits of open data.},

BADA is based on a kinetic approach to aircraft performance modelling, which models aircraft forces. The intended use of BADA is trajectory simulation and prediction in Air Traffic Management (ATM) Research and Development and strategic planning in ground ATM operations. BADA is used for various ATM-related studies which require information on aircraft performances. The paper provides details on the existing BADA family 3 model and the latest achievements in the development of the new BADA family 4 model. Several examples of the applications of using BADA are provided, together with information on how to obtain access to BADA. Copyright q 2010 EUROCONTROL. All rights reserved.},

  url = {https://mode-s.org/decode/},
  abstract = {In the last twenty years, aircraft surveillance has moved from controller-based interrogation to automatic broadcast. The Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) is one of the most common methods for aircraft to report their state information like identity, position, and speed. Like other Mode S communications, ADS-B makes use of the 1090 megahertz transponder to transmit data. The protocol for ADS-B is open, and low-cost receivers can easily be used to intercept its signals. Many recent air transportation studies have benefited from this open data source. However, the current literature does not offer a systematic exploration of Mode S and ADS-B data, nor does it explain the decoding process. This book tackles this missing area in the literature. It offers researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts a clear guide to understanding and making use of open ADS-B and Mode S data. The first part of this book presents the knowledge required to get started with decoding these signals. It includes background information on primary radar, secondary radar, Mode A/C, Mode S, and ADS-B, as well as the hardware and software setups necessary to gather radio signals. After that, the 17 core chapters of the book investigate the details of all types of ADS-B signals and commonly used Mode S signals. Throughout these chapters, examples and sample Python code are used extensively to explain and demonstrate the decoding process. Finally, the last chapter of the book offers a summary and a brief overview of research topics that go beyond the decoding of these signals},

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

What are the rules that underlie the production of pie charts, bar charts, scatterplots, function plots, maps, mosaics, and radar charts? Those less interested in the theoretical and mathematical foundations can still get a sense of the richness and structure of the system by examining the numerous and often unique color graphics it can produce. The second edition is almost twice the size of the original, with six new chapters and substantial revision. Much of the added material makes this book suitable for survey courses in visualization and statistical graphics.},
