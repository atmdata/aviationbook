  abstract = {This paper gives an overview of Base of Aircraft Data (BADA), an Aircraft Performance Model developed and maintained by EUROCONTROL. BADA is based on a kinetic approach to aircraft performance modelling, which models aircraft forces. The intended use of BADA is trajectory simulation and prediction in Air Traffic Management (ATM) Research and Development and strategic planning in ground ATM operations. BADA is used for various ATM-related studies which require information on aircraft performances. The paper provides details on the existing BADA family 3 model and the latest achievements in the development of the new BADA family 4 model. Several examples of the applications of using BADA are provided, together with information on how to obtain access to BADA. Copyright q 2010 EUROCONTROL. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This book was written for statisticians, computer scientists, geographers, researchers, and others interested in visualizing data. It presents a unique foundation for producing almost every quantitative graphic found in scientific journals, newspapers, statistical packages, and data visualization systems. While the tangible results of this work have been several visualization software libraries, this book focuses on the deep structures involved in producing quantitative graphics from data. What are the rules that underlie the production of pie charts, bar charts, scatterplots, function plots, maps, mosaics, and radar charts? Those less interested in the theoretical and mathematical foundations can still get a sense of the richness and structure of the system by examining the numerous and often unique color graphics it can produce. The second edition is almost twice the size of the original, with six new chapters and substantial revision. Much of the added material makes this book suitable for survey courses in visualization and statistical graphics.},
