  abstract = {This paper gives an overview of Base of Aircraft Data (BADA), an Aircraft Performance Model developed and maintained by EUROCONTROL. BADA is based on a kinetic approach to aircraft performance modelling, which models aircraft forces. The intended use of BADA is trajectory simulation and prediction in Air Traffic Management (ATM) Research and Development and strategic planning in ground ATM operations. BADA is used for various ATM-related studies which require information on aircraft performances. The paper provides details on the existing BADA family 3 model and the latest achievements in the development of the new BADA family 4 model. Several examples of the applications of using BADA are provided, together with information on how to obtain access to BADA. Copyright q 2010 EUROCONTROL. All rights reserved.},
