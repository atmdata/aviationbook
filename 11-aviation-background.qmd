# Aviation 101


:::{.callout-note}
**Author's note**: This part brings in the minimal background necessary to comprehend the
aviation world, including vocabulary and historical aspects which led to
the current situation.

not sure this is an own part, but it might be good to have a
small section speaking about aviation vs air transport, airspace
vs controlled/ATC, airport airside (landside or why we skip this),
active/secondary surveillance, \.... This might be the place to
also speak about trajectory \~ flight and other basics.
