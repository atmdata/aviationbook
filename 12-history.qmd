## The history of longitude

Knowledge of both latitudes and longitudes are crucial to both cartography and navigation. Latitudes have been relatively easy to determine with a reasonable precision by observing the stars in the sky and measuring their altitudes (angles of elevation). In 3rd century BC, [Erathostenes of Cyrene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes) estimated the radius of Earth after he measured a difference of latitudes of 7.2° (the fiftieth part of 360°) between Alexandria and Syene based on the Sun position.

On the other hand, the precise measurement of longitude took centuries of studies, with serious advances coming with the development of telescopes and accurate clocks.

[Gemma Frisius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemma_Frisius), a Dutch mathematician, first suggested travelling with a clock to determine longitudes in the 16th century. The clock would be set to the local time of a starting point whose longitude was known, and the longitude of any other place could be determined by comparing its local time with the clock time. However, this method required precise mechanical clocks which were not available at that time.

In the 17th century, [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei) is known for his work on orbital periods of Jupiter's four brightest satellites (Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto): he determined that sufficiently accurate knowledge of their orbits could be used as a universal clock, making it possible to determine longitudes. However, the method required a telescope, as the moons are not visible to the naked eye.

In the 18th century, triangulations were implemented in order to construct more precise maps of the territory, to calculate the radius of Earth and to determine whether the excentricity of our planet made it flattened at the pole (like a tangerine) or at the Equator (like a lemon). Triangulations performed in Laponia and Peru determined in favour of the first option. Precise measures of angles and the law of sines leveraged precise measures of distances between landmarks on the Paris Meridian (see [Cassini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9sar-Fran%C3%A7ois_Cassini_de_Thury)), leading to precise measurements of geographical coordinates as well.

Today, the precision we get with global position systems (GPS) also depends on the precision we can get with clocks, around the nanosecond.

## Radars

The fundamental theory of radar started in late 19th century. Since the 1860s, when the electromagnetic theory was discovered by [James Clerk Maxwell](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell), the foundation for many science and technology fields was laid out. In the late 19th century, [Heinrich Hertz](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Hertz), who proved the existence of electromagnetic waves, also confirmed that metals could reflect radio waves. In the first decades of the 20th century, several systems for using radio waves to provide short-range directional information of objects were developed. German inventor [Christian Hülsmeyer](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_H%C3%BClsmeyer) is often considered as the first person to use radio waves to detect metal objects in 1904.

However, not until the Second World War, was the concept of RAdio Detection And Ranging (RADAR) developed. The technology was simultaneously researched by both major Allies and Axis countries. However, the United Kingdom led the race in developing a functional radar system.

### The primary radar

Aircraft surveillance in the early days relied only on, what is known today as, the primary surveillance radar (PSR). The concept of PSR is fairly simple. It is a rotating radio transponder with an omnidirectional antenna. Commonly, the radar transmits a one-microsecond pulse for every one millisecond and listens to the reflections from the airplanes. The position of the aircraft is measured by the distance and angle to the radar. The distance is known as the slant distance, which is the line-of-sight distance between an aircraft and the radar. It can be calculated by measuring the time difference between the original signal and the reflection received, since the speed of the radio wave (speed of light) is known. The azimuth angle of the aircraft is determined by the rotation angle of the radar. By processing radar signals, technologies like phase filter and Doppler filter can be used to filter out moving targets like aircraft and remove static objects, such as mountains, buildings, and other obstacles.

The slant distance of an aircraft does not always correspond to the horizontal distance to the radar. This is because all points having the same slant distance are located on a sphere that has the radius equal to the distance. Since the civil radar usually does not provide elevation information on the target, it is not possible to accurately convert the slant distance to the horizontal distance. Historically, it is sufficient to use primary radar for separating airplanes without considering these altitude differences. However, other systems have to be in place to provide air traffic controllers more accurate positions of the aircraft.

### The secondary radar

- add sexy picture of SSR
:::

The secondary surveillance radar (SSR), also known as the air traffic control radar beacon system (ATCRBS), was designed to provide air traffic controllers more information than what is provided by the primary radar. The secondary radar can be installed separately or installed on top of the primary radar. It uses a different radio frequency to actively interrogate the aircraft and receive information transmitted by the aircraft.

The SSR transmits interrogations using the 1030 MHz radio frequency and the aircraft transponder transmits replies using the 1090 MHz radio frequency. In the early design of SSR, two civilian communication protocols (Mode A and Mode C) were introduced. Mode A and Mode C respectively allow the SSR to continuously interrogate the identity (squawk code) and the altitude of an aircraft. The squawk code in Mode A is a unique 4-octal digit code given by air traffic controllers to aircraft in their flight information region for identification. The altitude in Mode C refers to the barometric altitude obtained from the aircraft’s air data system.

- add picture of VOR ground station
- link to decoding with SDR ? (rather easy)
:::

VOR stations were developped in the United States in the 1930s before being deployed after the Second World War. VOR are simple short-ranged ground stations using radio waves to allow any receiver locked on its frequency to determine its bearing with respect to the ground station.

A VOR ground station operates on line of sight (about 200 nautical miles). It uses a phased antenna array to send a strong omnidirectional signal on a determined frequency, serving as a reference for comparison with a highly directional signal rotating clockwise. The phase difference between the reference signal and the directional signal is the bearing from the VOR station to the receiver relative to magnetic north.

VOR stations are often collocated with DME (Distance Measuring Equipments) which measure the distance between an aircraft and a ground station, by timing the propagation delay of radio signals initiated by the airborne interrogator and replicated after a known delay. Again, precise clocks are key to a precise measurement of distances.

Today, VOR stations are being gradually decommissioned as navigation aids move to performance-based navigation.

## Airways structure

**TODO**

- add an excerpt of route map
:::

VOR were traditionally used as intersections along airways. A typical airway will jump in non necessarily straight lines from one navigational point to 
another. Typical navigational points can be defined as:

- a NDB (Non Directional Beacon, the ancestor of VOR), VOR or DME ground station;
- intersections between two radials from different VOR stations;
- a VOR radial and a DME distance.

Today, more navigational points are defined as simple GPS coordinates.
