**Author's note**: The most overlooked aspect of data analysis probably turns around data
sharing. Data curation is often a very time consuming process and
enriching data by labelling specific tags or merging several sources of
information brings additional value to a dataset. This part deals with
the data sharing and publication process. (paper reproducibility?)

*Introduction about reproducible research. This would also include
sharing the code beyond the dataset cleaning to producing related
summaries, tables/graphics, etc.*

1.  **Good practices for producing a clean dataset**
    > \#include and use some of the datasets in 'traffic' / Zenodo /
    > ... these could be used in the examples in the book (and it would
    > be great to explain how to arrive to a clean dataset)

2.  **Issues around dataset sharing**
    > open data, licensing, etc.?
